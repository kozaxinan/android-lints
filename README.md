Custom set of android lints rules.

### ImmutableDataClassRule - Error
Kotlin data classes should be immutable by design. Having var in a data class is code smell. Use copy() method when instance needs to be modified.

### NetworkLayerImmutableClassRule - Warning
Classes used in network layer should be immutable by design. This lint checks Retrofit interface methods' return type for immutability. Java classes need to have final fields and kotlin data classes need to have only val fields.

If you want to use this rule, please configure you lint.xml.
```
<issue id="NetworkLayerImmutableClassRule" severity="error" />
```

### NetworkLayerClassSerializedNameRule - Information
Classes used in network layer with Gson should use SerializedName annotation. This lint checks Retrofit interface methods' return type for SerializedName annotation. Adding annotation rule to prevent obfuscation errors. If you don't use Gson for Retrofit, this check is useless. That is why it is `infromation` level. 

If you want to use this rule, please configure you lint.xml. 
```
<issue id="NetworkLayerClassSerializedNameRule" severity="error" />
```

### NetworkLayerClassJsonRule - Information
Classes used in network layer with Moshi should use Json annotation. This lint checks Retrofit interface methods' return type for Json annotation. Adding annotation rule to prevent obfuscation errors. If you don't use Moshi for Retrofit, this check is useless. That is why it is `infromation` level. 

If you want to use this rule, please configure you lint.xml. 
```
<issue id="NetworkLayerClassJsonRule" severity="error" />
```

### NetworkLayerClassJsonClassRule - Information
Classes used in network layer with Moshi should use JsonClass annotation to generate the adaptor class. This lint checks Retrofit interface methods' return type for JsonClass annotation. If you don't use Moshi for Retrofit, this check is useless. That is why it is `infromation` level. 

If you want to use this rule, please configure you lint.xml. 
```
<issue id="NetworkLayerClassJsonRule" severity="error" />
```

# Usage
